BREADCRUMBS
---

<img align="center" src="/static/img/screenshots/homepage.png" width="700">

**Breadcrumbs** is a web application designed to let foodies search restaurants, track their eating history, as well as connect with friends. If you have trouble remembering what restaurants you’ve been to before, or what you’ve ordered at a restaurant that was good, then Breadcrumbs is your go-to app.

Search for restaurants by name or address. With the queried results, you can select and add a restaurant that you have visited to your own personal map, leaving behind a trail of breadcrumbs for your restaurant history. Connect with friends to see where your friends have dined at and what dishes they've tried. Breadcrumbs is a social media network built for foodies.

## <a name="installation"></a>Installation
If you would like to run Breadcrumbs locally, please follow these instructions. Otherwise, please check out the deployed version of Breadcrumbs here: [ah-breadcrumbs.herokuapp.com](http://ah-breadcrumbs.herokuapp.com).

### Prerequisite:

Install [PostgreSQL](http://postgresapp.com) (Mac OSX).

Postgres needs to be running in order for the app to work. It is running when you see the elephant icon:

<img align="center" src="/static/img/screenshots/postgres-icon.png" width="200">

Add /bin directory to your path to use PostgreSQL commands and install the Python library.

Use Sublime to edit `~/.bash_profile` or `~/.profile`, and add:

```export PATH=/Applications/Postgres.app/Contents/Versions/9.5/bin/:$PATH```

### Set up Breadcrumbs:

Clone this repository:

```$ git clone https://github.com/ashleyhsia0/breadcrumbs.git```

Create a virtual environment and activate it:

```
$ virtualenv env
$ source env/bin/activate
```

Install the dependencies:

```$ pip install -r requirements.txt```

Get an API key from Yelp and store in a secrets.sh or use a JSON per the Yelp API documentation, but make sure to put the file in your `.gitignore`.

Run PostgreSQL (make sure elephant icon is active).

Create database with the name `breadcrumbs`.

```$ createdb breadcrumbs```

Seed the database with restaurants:

```$ python seed.py```

Finally, to run the app, start the server:

```$ python server.py```

Go to `localhost:5000` in your browser to start using Breadcrumbs!

## <a name="testing"></a>Testing & Coverage
Unit Tests, Integration Tests, and Selenium Tests have been implemented.

Coverage is currently at 82%.

<img align="center" src="/static/img/screenshots/testing-coverage.png" width="500">

To run tests, run the following command line:

```$ coverage run --omit=env/* tests/tests.py```

To get a coverage report, run the following:

```$ coverage report -m```

For an HTML version of the report, run the running:

```
$ coverage html
$ open htmlcov/index.html
```

To perform the Selenium tests, run the following command line:
